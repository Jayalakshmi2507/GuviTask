2.I have deployed an application in guvi.com:9000, and logs show my app is running, but Iâ€™m unable to view the page. Check whether my port is open or not ?

Answer: netstat -tulnp | grep 9000

This command will ensure whether the port 9000 is occupied or not. We are using grep to find the specific port here.
